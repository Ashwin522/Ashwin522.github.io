            The Driver Monitoring System is a project aimed at monitoring and ensuring the safety of drivers during their journeys.
            This system utilizes advanced technologies to track driver behavior, detect signs of drowsiness or distraction,
            and provide real-time feedback to enhance road safety.

        <p>
            The system is implemented using computer vision algorithms and machine learning models.
            It integrates with in-vehicle cameras to capture and analyze the driver's facial expressions and movements.
            The model is trained to recognize patterns associated with fatigue or distraction and triggers alerts when necessary.
